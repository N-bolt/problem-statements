# BDPA National HSCC 2019 Problem Statement

This was not the problem statement issued during the 2019 competition, but it is
very similar. It has been retrofitted to conform with the new competition format
and is suitable for teams to train with for future competitions.

The demo implementation of this solution can be found
[here](https://github.com/nhscc/2019.solutions.hscc.bdpa.org).
